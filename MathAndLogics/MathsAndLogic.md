## Lesson 1. Mathematics and Liberal Education

## Lesson 2. The Fundamentals of Logic

### Statement
Statement = a sentence that is either true or false

- a question is not a statement
- we should be able to assign a truth value to it
- either true or false, not both, and not either 

Examples of statements

    The hat is red.

    The program failed.

### Negation
Negation = a statement that contains the opposite truth value of another statement.

    Statement:      The hat is red.
    Negation:       The hat is not red.

    Statement:      The program failed.
    Negation:       The program did not fail.

    Statement:      All men are mortal.
    Negation:       Some man is mortal.

    Statement:      The base anles are equal.
    Negation:       The base anles are not equal.

### Implications (if - then statements)
Examples of implications

    Statement 1:    It is a bird.
    Statement 2:    It flies.
    Implication:    If it is a bird, then it flies.

![](math_2_01.png)

If P, then Q. / P implies Q.
* P - antecedent
* Q - consequent 

### Converse Statement
- Original statement: If Q, then P
- Converse statement: If P, then Q.


     If it flies, then it is a bird.
 
A converse is not logically equivalent to an implication:

![](math_2_02.png)

### Inverse Statement 
Negation of both antecedent and consequent:

    Statement:      If P, then Q.
    Inverse:        If not P, not Q.

e.g.

    If it is not a bird, then it does not fly.

An inverse is not logically equivalent to an implication.

### Contrapositive
A statement that negates both the antecedent and the consequent, and then switches the order.

    Statement:          If it is a bird, then it flies
    Contrapositive:     If it does not fly, then it is not a bird.  // logically equivalent

    Statement:          If the money is not spent, then the program fails.
    Converse:           If the program fails, then the money is not spent.
    Inverse:            If the money is spent, then the pgoram does not fail.
    Contrapositive:     If the program does not fail, then the money is spent.  // logically equivalent

Implications are the building blocks for how we put our statements together to come up with an argument.

### Arguments

### Modus Ponens
Basic argument, affirming antecedent.

    Statement:                          All men are mortal.
    Mathematical if-then statement:     If it is a man, then he is mortal.
    Modus Ponens:                       If it is a man, then he is mortal.
                                        Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

### Modus Ponens > Fallacy
Fallacy = incorrect argument.

    Statement:                          If it is a man, then it is mortal.
                                        Flipper is not a man. Therefore, Flipper is not mortal.
                                        // Flipper (dolphin), absurd statement.

    // Fallaccy of denying the antecedent

### Modus Tollens
Denying the consequent

    If it rains, then I will take my umbrella.
    I did not take my unbrella. Therefore, it did not rain.

![](math_2_03.png)

### Modus Tollens > Fallacy
Fallacy of affirming the consequent.

    If it rains, then I will take my umbrella.
    I took the umbrella. Therefore, it rained.  // not valid

### Negation of an Implication

#### Reduction ad Absurdium
A proof by contradiction.

    Original implication:       If it is a bird, then it flies.
                                
    // we'll need to find sth that is not a bird, but flies.

![](math_2_04.png)

    Implication:            If P, then Q.
    Negation:               P = true; Q = not true

Logic - building blocks for reasoning:
- negation
- implication
- converse
- inverse
- contrapositive
- modus tollens
- modus ponens

## Lesson 3. Deductive Reasoning and the Transformation of Mathematics
Greeks transformed Maths.

### 3 Criteria for Maths
1. The objects of mathematics are abstract.
2. The foundation of mathematics is geometry.
3. The method of mathematics is deductive reasoning.

### Deductive Reasoning
The pursuit of logical consequences from a given system of initial universal truths.

Syllogism example

    All men are mortal.
    Socrates is a man.                  // this premis is particular
    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.      // conclusion is particular

Another example

    All men are mortal.                 // this premis is universal
    Angels are immortal.                // this premis is universal
    Therefore, men are not angels.      // conclusion is universal

### Advantages of Deductive Reasoning
1. It provides absolute certainty of result.
2. It demonstrates the necessary dependence of ideas with one another.

Inductive reasoning: argue from particulars to general (from observations to theory)

### Proof
A chain of statements, with justifications for each statement, that ends with a desired conclusion:
1. Direct proof.
2. Indirect proof (proof by contradiction or lat. - Reductio ad Absurdum)

### Direct Proof
A proof that uses only the given assumptions and statements that can be deduced from them in order to reach a conclusion.

### Indirect Proof
A proof that starts with the given assumptions, assumes that the desired conclusion is false, and derives a contradiction.

    "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,
    whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
                    Arthur Conan Doyle "The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet"

### Law of the Excluded Middle by Aristotle
A statement is either true or false.

    "For nothing about things would be comprehensible to anybody, neither of 
    things  in themselves, nor of one in relation to the other, i number and its 
    essensce were nonexistent. ... The essense of number, like harmony, does not 
    allow misunderstanding, for this is starnge to it."

    "Deception and envy are inherent to the unbounded, unknowable, and unreasonable.
    ... Truth, however, is inherent in the nature of number and inbred in it."
                                    Philolaus, on the Universe, "Fragment 11"

![](math_3_01.png)

More explicitly, 

    D / S = M / N

### Pythagorean theorem

![](math_3_02.png)

True? No, it's not possible

### Starting Assumption
![](math_3_03.png)

If we square both sides of the expression,

    2 = M^2 / N^2
    2N^2 = M^2

![](math_3_04.png)

    If M^2 is even, then M itself must be even.

Exercise

    If M is odd, then M^2 must be odd.

M must be even (the only alternative). Then, M must be a multiple of 2. Then,

    M^2 = (2K)^2 = 4K^2

![](math_3_05.png)

which is a contradiction:

    M is even
    N is even
    Both are divisible by 2
    2 is greater than 1

So, the starting assumption is false:

    sqrt 2 = M / N
    where M and N have no common divisor greater than 1     // false

Therefore, sqrt 2 is irrational.

### Types of numbers
1. Whole numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)
2. Integers (= whole numbers + their negatives)
3. Rational numbers (fractions: 2/3, 5/6, ...)
4. Irrational numbers (sqrt 2, cube root of 17, ...)
5. Transcendental numbers (PI - 3.141592653589793... , e - 2.71828...)

Numbers are insufficient means of describing the world of maths.

    sqrt 9 = 3
    sqrt 4 != 2, so number 2 is the source of irrationality

### Prime number
A number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself
(indivisible quantities (atoms) of integers)

    prime   not prime
    ----------------
    17      6
    
### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes.

    50 | 5, 5, 2    // 50 is product of 5, 5, and 2

![](math_3_05.png)

There are supposed to be numbers not on my list.

Supposed we have prime numbers:

    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ..., p
    multiply them and get a whole number
    whole number + 1 = Q
    Q must be divisible by some prime
    Q divided by any prime number on this list leaves a remainer of 1.

### Hardy's Criteria for Beauty
1. Economy
2. Inevitability
3. Unexpectedness 

### Hardy's Criteria for Seriousness
1. Significance ofo the results
2. Depth of the ideas
3. Generality of the notions involved

The availability of large prime numbers is a bedrock of RSA cryptography.

## Lesson 4. Begin at the Beginning: The Axioms of Euclidean Geometry

### Axiom
A statement we accept without proof.

### Goals of an axiom system
1. Complete - the number of axioms should be enough to derive all results we desire for our system.
2. Independent - not too many axioms, we shouldn't use anything that can be derived/proven from other theorems on the list.
3. Consistent - axioms should be in agreement with one another.

#### famous example: Euclid's Elements
Book 1 > Definitions > A point 

    A point has no size
                no thickness
                no width
                no breadth
                no depth
                no length

A straight line

    A line is length without breadth
    The extremities of a line are points
    A straight line is a line that liels evenly with the points on itself

    i.e. A line does not have to be straight, according to Euclid (= curve today).
         If Euclid refers to a straight line, he explicitly calls it 'a straight line'.

A right angle

![](math_4_01.png)

A circle 

    is a plain figure contained by a single line, such that all straight lines 
    falling on it from a single point within the figure are equal to one another.
    And that point is called the center of the circle.

### Definition 23
Parallel straight lines 

    are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely
    in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction.
    
### 10 Axioms of 2 categories
1. Postulates - geometric first principles for The Elements.
2. Common Notions - more general Maths definitions.

![](math_4_02.png)

### Postulates
Let the following be postulated:
1. To draw a straight line from any point to any other point. 
2. To produce a finite straight line or to continue it endlessly, indefinitely, in a straight line.
3. To describe a circle with any center and distance.
4. That all right angles are equal to one another.
5. That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.

Postulates 1, 2, and 3 are construction postulates.

Postulate 5 is different, and the most controversial:
- longer
- a visual cue is needed
- explicitly an if-then statement (form of propositions and theorems)
- invokes Euclid's other postulates
- is it independent?
- Euclid himself tends to avoid this postulate as much as he can

![](math_4_03.png)

### Common Notions

![](math_4_04.png)

1. Things which are equal to the same things are also equal to one another.
2. If equal be added to equals, the whole are equal.
3. If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
5. The whole is greater than the part.

    
    These 5 common notions stipulate the notion of equality
    // Euclids never defines equality, but often refers to it.

They are:
- agreeable
- self-evident
- worthy of acceptance.

### First Proposition

    On a given finite straight line it is possible to construct an equilateral triangle.

![](math_4_05.png)

Book 1 > Proposition 1 > Construction of an equilateral triangle

Step 1. Make a circle with centre at point A and Radius AB

![](math_4_06.png)

Step 2. The second circle having B as its center and AB as its Radius.

![](math_4_07.png)

Step 3. Find the point where circles meet and call it C. Draw straight lines C to A and C to B.

![](math_4_08.png)

Verify if it's an equilateral triangle:
- sides AB & AC are both radia of red circle, so AB = AC
- sides AB & BC are both radia of blue circle, AB = BC
- both AC and BC are equal to AB; therefore, equal to one another
=> equilateral triangle.

## Lesson 5. Neutral Geometry: The Early Propositions of Euclid's Elements
4 postulates

Proposition 1: ability to construct an equilateral triangle

![](math_5_01.png)

Of trilateral figures, 

    an equilateral triangle is that which has its three sides equal, 
    an isosceles triangle that which has two of its sides alone equal, and 
    a scalene triangle that which has its three sides unequal.

### Proposition 2

![](math_5_02.png)

To place at a given point a straight line equal to a given straight line.

![](math_5_03.png)

- Given point A and line segment BC
- Let's construct a line segment at A that has the same length as BC.
- Postulate 1: connect A and B; construct 2 circles based on A and B; find D at the crossing of A and B circles.

![](math_5_04.png)

- Triangle ABD is equilateral
- Postulate 2: Extend straight lines BD and AD as far as I needed to (indefinitely)

![](math_5_05.png)

- Construct a circle centered at B with Radius BC

![](math_5_06.png)

- Circle's intersection with line BD (extended) is point G 

![](math_5_07.png)

- BG = BC because they're both Radius of the same circle
- Now let's create a circle with the center of D and Radius DG

![](math_5_08.png)

- Line DA intersects with the circle at point L

![](math_5_09.png)

- Now I know that DG = Dl as they're the Radius of the same circle
- LD = DG
- DA = DB
- Therefore, AL = BG
- As BC = BG, 

![](math_5_10.png)

AL = BC, QED ("Quot erat demonstrandum" - что и требовалось доказать)

### Proposition 3

![](math_5_11.png)

Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a straight line equal to the less.

### Proposition 4
Congruence - side length, angles, and areas are identical.

![](math_5_12.png)

- If two sides and their angles of each triangle are equal, 
- then the rest side and two angles are equal as well.
- Additionally, areas of these triangles are equal.

### Proposition 6: superposition

### Proposition 8
![](math_5_13.png)

    If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, 
    and have also the base equal to the base, they will also have the 
    angles equal which are contained by the equal straight lines.

### Proposition 9

![](math_5_14.png)

- Start with an angle BAC
- pick a random point D on line AB
- by Proposition 2, move that line segment AD over on to AC -> create point E
- by Postulate 1, draw straight line from D to E

![](math_5_15.png)

- now we can build an equilateral triangle on top of that
- with a campus, make circles centered in D and E, 
- let's call this intersection point F

![](math_5_16.png)

- draw straight lines DF and EF, they have the same distance
- AD and AE are also constructed to have the same length

![](math_5_17.png)

Draw in a straight line AF

![](math_5_18.png)

- Now AF breaks down ADFE into 2 equilateral triangles
- two sides of one triangle ADF are equal to two sides of the other triangle AEF
- Also, AF is common to both of those triangles

- Triangles are congruent -> their corresponding parts are congruent; 
- therefore, all angles of one triangle are equal to those of the corresponding triangle, 
- Angle BAF = angle CAF, and we have bisected the angle.

Latitudes = circles (through North / South Poles)

### Proposition 15
![](math_5_19.png)

Vertical angles are equal to each other
