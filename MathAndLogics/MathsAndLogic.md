## Lesson 1. Mathematics and Liberal Education

## Lesson 2. The Fundamentals of Logic

### Statement
Statement = a sentence that is either true or false

- a question is not a statement
- we should be able to assign a truth value to it
- either true or false, not both, and not either 

Examples of statements

    The hat is red.

    The program failed.

### Negation
Negation = a statement that contains the opposite truth value of another statement.

    Statement:      The hat is red.
    Negation:       The hat is not red.

    Statement:      The program failed.
    Negation:       The program did not fail.

    Statement:      All men are mortal.
    Negation:       Some man is mortal.

    Statement:      The base anles are equal.
    Negation:       The base anles are not equal.

### Implications (if - then statements)
Examples of implications

    Statement 1:    It is a bird.
    Statement 2:    It flies.
    Implication:    If it is a bird, then it flies.

If P, then Q. / P implies Q.
* P - antecedent
* Q - consequent 

### Converse Statement
- Original statement: If Q, then P
- Converse statement: If P, then Q.


     If it flies, then it is a bird.
 
Converse is not logically equivalent to implication:
