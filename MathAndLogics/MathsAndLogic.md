## Lesson 1. Mathematics and Liberal Education

## Lesson 2. The Fundamentals of Logic

### Statement
Statement = a sentence that is either true or false

- a question is not a statement
- we should be able to assign a truth value to it
- either true or false, not both, and not either 

Examples of statements

    The hat is red.

    The program failed.

### Negation
Negation = a statement that contains the opposite truth value of another statement.

    Statement:      The hat is red.
    Negation:       The hat is not red.

    Statement:      The program failed.
    Negation:       The program did not fail.

    Statement:      All men are mortal.
    Negation:       Some man is mortal.

    Statement:      The base anles are equal.
    Negation:       The base anles are not equal.

### Implications (if - then statements)
Examples of implications

    Statement 1:    It is a bird.
    Statement 2:    It flies.
    Implication:    If it is a bird, then it flies.

![](math_1_01.png)

If P, then Q. / P implies Q.
* P - antecedent
* Q - consequent 

### Converse Statement
- Original statement: If Q, then P
- Converse statement: If P, then Q.


     If it flies, then it is a bird.
 
A converse is not logically equivalent to an implication:

![](math_1_02.png)

### Inverse Statement 
Negation of both antecedent and consequent:

    Statement:      If P, then Q.
    Inverse:        If not P, not Q.

e.g.

    If it is not a bird, then it does not fly.

An inverse is not logically equivalent to an implication.

### Contrapositive
A statement that negates both the antecedent and the consequent, and then switches the order.

    Statement:          If it is a bird, then it flies
    Contrapositive:     If it does not fly, then it is not a bird.  // logically equivalent

    Statement:          If the money is not spent, then the program fails.
    Converse:           If the program fails, then the money is not spent.
    Inverse:            If the money is spent, then the pgoram does not fail.
    Contrapositive:     If the program does not fail, then the money is spent.  // logically equivalent

Implications are the building blocks for how we put our statements together to come up with an argument.

### Arguments

### Modus Ponens
Basic argument, affirming antecedent.

    Statement:                          All men are mortal.
    Mathematical if-then statement:     If it is a man, then he is mortal.
    Modus Ponens:                       If it is a man, then he is mortal.
                                        Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

### Modus Ponens > Fallacy
Fallacy = incorrect argument.

    Statement:                          If it is a man, then it is mortal.
                                        Flipper is not a man. Therefore, Flipper is not mortal.
                                        // Flipper (dolphin), absurd statement.

    // Fallaccy of denying the antecedent

### Modus Tollens
Denying the consequent

    If it rains, then I will take my umbrella.
    I did not take my unbrella. Therefore, it did not rain.

![](math_1_03.png)

### Modus Tollens > Fallacy
Fallacy of affirming the consequent.

    If it rains, then I will take my umbrella.
    I took the umbrella. Therefore, it rained.  // not valid

### Negation of an Implication

#### Reduction ad Absurdium
A proof by contradiction.

    Original implication:       If it is a bird, then it flies.
                                
    // we'll need to find sth that is not a bird, but flies.

![](math_1_04.png)

    Implication:            If P, then Q.
    Negation:               P = true; Q = not true

Logic - building blocks for reasoning:
- negation
- implication
- converse
- inverse
- contrapositive
- modus tollens
- modus ponens

## Lesson 3. Deductive Reasoning and the Transformation of Mathematics
Greeks transformed Maths.

### 3 Criteria for Maths
1. The objects of mathematics are abstract.
2. The foundation of mathematics is geometry.
3. The method of mathematics is deductive reasoning.

### Deductive Reasoning
The pursuit of logical consequences from a given system of initial universal truths.

Syllogism example

    All men are mortal.
    Socrates is a man.                  // this premis is particular
    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.      // conclusion is particular

Another example

    All men are mortal.                 // this premis is universal
    Angels are immortal.                // this premis is universal
    Therefore, men are not angels.      // conclusion is universal

### Advantages of Deductive Reasoning
1. It provides absolute certainty of result.
2. It demonstrates the necessary dependence of ideas with one another.

Inductive reasoning: argue from particulars to general (from observations to theory)

### Proof
A chain of statements, with justifications for each statement, that ends with a desired conclusion:
1. Direct proof.
2. Indirect proof (proof by contradiction or lat. - Reductio ad Absurdum)

### Direct Proof
A proof that uses only the given assumptions and statements that can be deduced from them in order to reach a conclusion.

### Indirect Proof
A proof that starts with the given assumptions, assumes that the desired conclusion is false, and derives a contradiction.

    "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,
    whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
                    Arthur Conan Doyle "The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet"

### Law of the Excluded Middle by Aristotle
A statement is either true or false.

    "For nothing about things would be comprehensible to anybody, neither of 
    things  in themselves, nor of one in relation to the other, i number and its 
    essensce were nonexistent. ... The essense of number, like harmony, does not 
    allow misunderstanding, for this is starnge to it."

    "Deception and envy are inherent to the unbounded, unknowable, and unreasonable.
    ... Truth, however, is inherent in the nature of number and inbred in it."
                                    Philolaus, on the Universe, "Fragment 11"

![](math_2_01.png)

More explicitly, 

    D / S = M / N

### Pythagorean theorem

![](math_2_02.png)

True? No, it's not possible

### Starting Assumption
![](math_2_03.png)

If we square both sides of the expression,

    2 = M^2 / N^2
    2N^2 = M^2

![](math_2_04.png)

    If M^2 is even, then M itself must be even.

Exercise

    If M is odd, then M^2 must be odd.

M must be even (the only alternative). Then, M must be a multiple of 2. Then,

    M^2 = (2K)^2 = 4K^2

![](math_2_05.png)

which is a contradiction:

    M is even
    N is even
    Both are divisible by 2
    2 is greater than 1

So, the starting assumption is false:

    sqrt 2 = M / N
    where M and N have no common divisor greater than 1     // false

Therefore, sqrt 2 is irrational.

### Types of numbers
1. Whole numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)
2. Integers (= whole numbers + their negatives)
3. Rational numbers (fractions: 2/3, 5/6, ...)
4. Irrational numbers (sqrt 2, cube root of 17, ...)
5. Transcendental numbers (PI - 3.141592653589793... , e - 2.71828...)

Numbers are insufficient means of describing the world of maths.

    sqrt 9 = 3
    sqrt 4 != 2, so number 2 is the source of irrationality

### Prime number
A number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself
(indivisible quantities (atoms) of integers)

    prime   not prime
    ----------------
    17      6
    
### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes.

    50 | 5, 5, 2    // 50 is product of 5, 5, and 2

![](math_2_05.png)

There are supposed to be numbers not on my list.

Supposed we have prime numbers:

    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ..., p
    multiply them and get a whole number
    whole number + 1 = Q
    Q must be divisible by some prime
    Q divided by any prime number on this list leaves a remainer of 1.

### Hardy's Criteria for Beauty
1. Economy
2. Inevitability
3. Unexpectedness 

### Hardy's Criteria for Seriousness
1. Significance ofo the results
2. Depth of the ideas
3. Generality of the notions involved

The availability of large prime numbers is a bedrock of RSA cryptography.
